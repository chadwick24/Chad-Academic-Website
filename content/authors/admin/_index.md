Hello, and welcome to my academic webpage! I am Chad Dulle, a PhD student in Finance at the University of Cincinnati. My primary research interests revolve around behavioral finance and corporate governance, with a specific emphasis on understanding how the personal characteristics of the firm's upper-management affect their decision-making and impact firm outcomes.

I am also intensely curious about the burgeoning field of FinTech, particularly in the transformative potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. I actively participate in the Bitcoin Blockchain and have had the opportunity to lead seminars enlightening finance faculty about these cutting-edge technologies. 

Beyond my research, I am genuinely passionate about teaching. I believe in cultivating an environment that encourages curiosity, fosters critical thinking, and prepares students for the dynamic world of finance.

Please feel free to explore my webpage for more detailed information about my research, teaching philosophy, and other interests. If you have questions, feel free to send me an email (dullecd@mail.uc.edu). Thank you for your visit!
