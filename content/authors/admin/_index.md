Hello, welcome to my website! My name is Chad Dulle, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Finance at the University of Cincinnati. My primary research interests include behavioral corporate finance, social finance, and fintech. I am particularly interested in how social networks affect the adoption of cryptocurrency as a speculative asset.
