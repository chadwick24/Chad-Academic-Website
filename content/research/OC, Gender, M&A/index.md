Existing research documents significant gender and overconfidence effects in the merger and 
acquisition (M&A) decisions of firms. Namely, firms with female leadership tend to be less 
acquisitive, while firms with overconfident executives are more acquisitive. What is less clear is how 
these personal characteristics interact. To understand the underlying dynamics, I examine the 
interplay between these two effects. I find that non-overconfident female executives drive the 
negative gender effect on M&A activity. By contrast, overconfident female executives behave 
similarly to non-overconfident male executives. This suggests that when studying how executive 
characteristics affect corporate decision-making, we need a more holistic approach: Gender is not 
simply a proxy for overconfidence and both gender and behavioral characteristics of the executive 
must be considered.
