We examine the Twitter behavior of overconfident CEOs and explore its potential implications for their respective firms. Given the propensity of overconfident CEOs to engage in risk-taking behaviors, we postulate that these characteristics will be apparent in their Twitter activities. In particular, we hypothesize that overconfident CEOs, buoyed by their inflated confidence in generating positive outcomes, would perceive Twitter's low barriers to entry as an attractive platform for public relations, leading to more engagement. Furthermore, we explore other potential differences in Twitter behavior between overconfident and non-overconfident CEOs, including the frequency of tweeting during significant firm events, the disclosure of financial information, and sentiment use.
