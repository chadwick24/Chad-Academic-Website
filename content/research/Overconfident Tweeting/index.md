We examine the Twitter behavior of overconfident CEOs and explore its potential implications for their respective firms. Given the propensity of overconfident CEOs to engage in risk-taking behaviors, we postulate that these characteristics will be apparent in their Twitter activities. In particular, we hypothesize that overconfident CEOs, buoyed by their inflated confidence in generating positive outcomes, would perceive Twitter's low barriers to entry as an attractive platform for public relations, leading to more engagement. Furthermore, we explore other potential differences in Twitter behavior between overconfident and non-overconfident CEOs, including the frequency of tweeting during significant firm events, the disclosure of financial information, and sentiment use.

To explore these dynamics, we start by manually gathering Twitter handles for CEOs and firms in the S&P1500. This includes both firm-specific handles (e.g., @Tesla) and CEO-specific handles (e.g., @elonmusk), each collected separately due to the potential variances in incentives for firms and CEOs to maintain a Twitter account. Using Twitter's API, we then scrape the entire tweet history from 2006 to 2022 for these handles, amassing over 33 million unique tweets along with related metadata. Additionally, we collect firms' 8K filings via SEC's Edgar database to pinpoint key firm events. Leveraging an option-based proxy for overconfidence proposed by Malmendier and Tate (2005), we categorize each CEO as overconfident or not.
Preliminary findings affirm our initial hypothesis, showing that firms with overconfident CEOs tweet significantly more, across both firm-specific and CEO-specific accounts. However, increased tweeting during a 3-day window around firm events is limited to firm-specific accounts. Interestingly, when comparing Twitter activity during event windows to non-event periods, we find an abnormal surge in Twitter usage for firms led by overconfident CEOs, particularly around significant events. The sentiment of these tweets is also abnormally positive. These effects are amplified when the firm discloses multiple significant events on the same day.
