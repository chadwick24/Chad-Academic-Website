The objective of this course is to describe in detail what financial markets are and how financial institutions operate within them. In doing so, we will learn how financial markets and institutions shape the broader economy. Students will be introduced to the theory, structure, management, and regulation of financial institutions. We will be particularly interested in understanding the interest rate - the economic factors that influence the interest rate, the economic factors that are influenced by the interest rate, and what that means for the economy. In addition, we will learn about the role and effects of government regulation on financial markets, and the risks financial institutions face. By focusing on how and why financial markets and institutions exist, and what financial institutions do, students will also gain insight into the evolution of the industry and a better understanding of how financial institutions promote economic development and efficiency.
