In this core finance course, we explore the fundamental principles of finance, focusing on the key concepts of the time value of money and the risk-return tradeoff. This 'tools' course equips you with the necessary skills to analyze a wide variety of financial decisions. We place a significant emphasis on learning how to think systematically about financial valuation and how to apply these insights to a range of business (e.g., capital budgeting decisions) and personal (e.g., retirement planning, automobile and mortgage loans) financial problems.

Throughout the course, we:

- Delve into the various types of financial management decisions and study the pivotal role of a financial manager within a firm
- Investigate financial statements, calculate and interpret key ratios to gain a deep understanding of financial health
- Unravel the complexities of the time value of money and use this vital technique to make informed decisions across personal and business contexts
- Evaluate financial assets and cultivate the skills required to accurately value these resources
- Scrutinize potential investment opportunities and assess their feasibility for capital budgeting purposes

To truly grasp the value and potential of blockchain technology, we must first understand its fundamental components. This session will delve into the core mechanics that underpin lockchain systems. We will introduce and explain the following key elements:

- Digital Signatures: We will discuss the role of digital signatures in verifying the authenticity of data and ensuring the integrity of transactions on the blockchain.

- One-Way Encryption: We'll explore the concept of one-way encryption (also known as hashing), a crucial aspect of securing data on a blockchain. Attendees will learn how this cryptographic technique contributes to the immutability and security of the blockchain.

- Hash Functions: We will delve into the specifics of hash functions and their importance in linking blocks together in the chain, contributing to the tamper-evident nature of the technology.

By the end of this seminar, attendees will have a foundational understanding of these concepts, paving the way for more in-depth discussions on the applications of blockchain technology in finance.
