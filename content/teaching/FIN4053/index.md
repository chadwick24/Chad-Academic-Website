<small>
The objective of this course is to describe in detail what financial markets are and how financial institutions operate within them. In doing so, we will learn how financial markets and institutions shape the broader economy. Students will be introduced to the theory, structure, management, and regulation of financial institutions. We will be particularly interested in understanding the interest rate - the economic factors that influence the interest rate, the economic factors that are influenced by the interest rate, and what that means for the economy. In addition, we will learn about the role and effects of government regulation on financial markets, and the risks financial institutions face. By focusing on how and why financial markets and institutions exist, and what financial institutions do, students will also gain insight into the evolution of the industry and a better understanding of how financial institutions promote economic development and efficiency.

# Topics Covered

#### What Do Interest Rates Mean, And What Is Their Role In Valuation?

We kick off this section by deciphering the concept of interest rates and refreshing key time value of money principles. We then draw a clear line between real and nominal interest rates. This exploration sets the stage for students to appreciate the vital role interest rates play within the financial markets.


#### Why Do Interest Rates Change?

Because asset values fluctuate with interest rates, it is important to understand how and why interest rates change. We introduce the theory of portfolio choice, review the basics of bond pricing, examine the bond market, and discuss what causes shifts in the supply and demand for bonds. 


#### How Do Risk and Term Structure Affect Interest Rates?

In this section we investigate why different bonds have different interest rates. Namely, bonds that have the same term to maturity may carry different levels of risk - the risk structure - and bonds with identical risk have different term to maturity - the term structure. We examine the yield curve and talk about its significance in predicting recessions.

#### Are Financial Markets Efficient?

Is the stock market accurately priced? Can you beat the market? We revisit the first fundamental law of finance and formalize the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). Next, we discuss the prominent arguments for and against EMH, and examine review some empirical findings including CAPM, the excess volatility puzzle, the size effect, and more. We end this section by introducing behavioral economics and behavioral finance. In doing so, students get a primer on psychology and how heuristics (i.e. "the fast thinking brain") can lead to behavioral biases. 


#### Why Do Financial Institutions Exist?



#### The Federal Reserve And Monetary Policy

#### Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrency

This section demystifies blockchain technology, with a keen focus on its initial implementation: Bitcoin. We dissect the underlying mechanics of cryptocurrency, before scrutinizing Bitcoin's economic prospects as an alternative to traditional fiat currencies. Culminating this section, we draw a clear distinction between Bitcoin and Ethereum, emphasizing Ethereum's unique offerings like smart contracts, decentralized applications, and its role in propelling 'Web3'.
